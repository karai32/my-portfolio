But it turned out to be a completely new experience! What’s cool is that you have to break the site into components, not just can. It really makes navigating the project easier. Though, the /components folder is getting pretty stuffed. 😅 \n\n I was also impressed with npm (the package manager). Instead of importing tons of JS libraries for every task, like phone number masking or website translation, you can just install everything through it. Well, let’s see what else I’ll hook up to this site. 😏"

Setting it up wasn’t too hard, thankfully there’s documentation with a step-by-step guide for people like me. But manually translating every single piece of text on the site — that’s a real pain! Seriously, I spent a ton of time on it. Oh, and there was this annoying issue where i18next wouldn’t load multiple JSON translation files for the same language at once. But hey, it looks pretty cool now, so it was worth it! 🙌"
